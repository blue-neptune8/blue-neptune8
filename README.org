* 👋 Hi there! I'm @blue-neptune8

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

* 🚀 About Me
I'm a beginner in the world of machine learning, strong believer in the future of mixed reality, personal compute access and /e/acc/. Big supporter of the Julia programming language, and other unique approaches to programming that try to move the world of computing forward. Very curious about the rapid developments of AI and how they shape the future world.

Here's a bit about what I do:

- 🤖 Machine Learning
- 🎥 Motion Capture
- 🖥️ Data Processing
- ⚛️ Physics
